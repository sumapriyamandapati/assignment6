# CS649 Assignment 6

In this assignment, you will use React-Bootstrap to stylize your application. The instructions are simple and involve nothing more than the following:
1) Install React-Bootstrap.
2) Convert your navigation menu into a Bootstrap navigation menu. You will need to install and use React-Router-Bootstrap to finish this.
   * Use at least 3 components in your design. Pick from:
     1. Button
     2. Panel
     3. Table
     4. Form objects
     5. Toasts (might be a bit more complicated than you'll want for this assignment)
     6. Modal
     7. Validation Alert
     8. etc.

There is no directive in how you use the React-Bootstrap components. All I ask is that you be creative in your usage of them!
